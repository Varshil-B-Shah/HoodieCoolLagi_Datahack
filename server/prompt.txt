1.  Introduction  1.1 Purpose  Howard University (HU) resources, such as Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, are to be  used for Howard business purposes in serving the interests of the University.  The participation and support of every student, faculty, employee and affiliate who deals with  information and/or information systems is necessary to achieve effective security. It is the  responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their activities  accordingly.  The purpose of this policy is to delineate acceptable use of HU technology resources. These rules  are in place to protect the user of these resources and the University. Inappropriate use exposes  HU to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal  issues.  1.2 Scope  This policy applies to all Howard University networks, both the perimeter and the infrastructure,  and the parties with which we do businesses.  1.3 Maintenance  This Policy will be reviewed by the Universitys Information Security Office annually or as  deemed appropriate based on changes in technology or regulatory requirements.  1.4 Enforcement  Violations of this Policy may result in suspension or loss of the violators use privileges, with  respect to University-owned Information Systems.  Additional administrative sanctions may  apply; up to and including termination of employment or contractor status with the University, or  expulsion of student workers. Civil, criminal and equitable remedies may also apply.  1.5 Exceptions  Exceptions to this Policy must be approved by the Information Security Office, under the  guidance of the Universitys Provost, or Chief Operations Officer. All exceptions will be  formally documented.  Policy exceptions will be reviewed on a periodic basis for  appropriateness.

2. Policy  The data network is a shared resource used by the entire University community and its affiliates  in support of the business processes and academic missions. Business units and community  members must cooperate to protect the network by securing computers and network devices in  order to secure access. In addition, they must certify that the devices connecting to the business  units network are in compliance with the policies and procedures as established by Enterprise  Technology Services (ETS).   Concurrently, academic, administrative and support units are responsible for the efcient,  effective and secure operation of their local networks. This policy is designed to help protect the  Universitys central and distributed telecommunications and computing environment from  accidental, or intentional damage, and from alteration or theft of data while preserving  appropriate access and use.   This policy is established under the provisions of Howard Universitys Information Security  Policy Program.  The following rules define the ETSs policy regarding access to the University network:  1.   Only authorized people can gain access to Howard Universitys networks.     Positive identification is required for system usage. All users must have their    identities positively identified with user-IDs and secure passwords--or by other    means that provide equal or greater security--prior to being  permitted to use    Howard University-owned computers.  2.    User-IDs must each uniquely identify a single user. Each computer user-ID must    uniquely identify only one user, so as to ensure individual accountability in    system logs. Shared or group user-IDs are not permitted.  3.  Use of service accounts for local log-ins by any individual is prohibited. This    rule is designed to prevent unauthorized changes to production data by    accounts that allow groups of users to employ the same password. In cases    where users require authorities inherent in service accounts, the users    manager must obtain approval from ETS. Those privileges may be  assigned to    individual users on as-needed basis and must be revoked when they are no longer    necessary.    4.  Access controls required for remote systems connecting to production         systems. All computers that have remote real-time dialogs with Howard        Universitys IT production systems must run an access control package         approved by ETS.  5.  Multiple simultaneous remote external network connections prohibited. Unless    special permission has been granted by the Director of Information  Organization  ETS  Title/Subject  Network Security Policy  Document Number    Author  Christopher Cole   Approved by   Tilmon Smith  Date  April 10, 2014  Version  2.0  Page 4

  Security, (CIO/CISO/ISM), computer systems must not allow any user to    conduct multiple simultaneous remote network connections.  6.  All log-in banners must include security notice. Every log-in screen for multi-   user computers must include a special notice. This notice must state: (1) the    system may only be accessed by authorized users, (2) users who log-in    represent that they are authorized to do so, (3) unauthorized system usage  or    abuse is subject to penalties, and (4) system usage will be monitored and logged.    7.  Security notice in log-in banner must not disclose system information.          All log-in banners on network-connected Howard University computer         systems must simply ask the user to log-in, providing terse prompts only        where essential. Identifying information about the organization, operating        system, system configuration, or other internal matters must not be         provided until a user's identity has been successfully authenticated.  8.  Users must log off before leaving sensitive systems unattended. If the     computer system to which users are connected or which they are currently  using    contains sensitive information, and especially if they have special access  rights,    such as domain admin or system administrator privileges, users must not leave    their computer, workstation, or terminal unattended without first logging-out,    locking the workstation, or invoking a password-protected screen saver.  9.  Academic, Administrative, and Supporting Enterprise Technology  Services staff    must:   a.  Follow policies and procedures, as established by ETS, to validate rewall  activation, operating system installation, application software security patches and  virus protection updates for all devices in the units areas of physical or  administrative control that are to be, or are congured to utilize network resources  that are controlled and managed by ETS.   b.  Follow policies and procedures, as established by ETS, for using  automated tools to test devices connected to the business units local wired or  wireless data network for compliance. Noncompliant devices are to be  disconnected, disabled or quarantined until the device is brought into compliance.  When devices are not compliant, operating units, or individuals and their  information technology staff must employ compensating controls. Units must  document compensating controls and/or any exceptions. These must be reviewed,  tested, and approved by Information Security.      The operating business unit or individual must retain the approved          documentation for audits as long as the device is in operation. Any          connection to the Internet, or to a national or regional network from a         private network operated by an academic, administrative, or support unit,        must be made via University network resources.

    of Enterprise Technology Services must approve any exceptions to this         requirement.  10.  All network access attempts (success or failure) must be logged and    retained for auditing.   11.  Server   Howard University embraces an open information technology environment to  encourage the use of technology in pursuit of the Universitys teaching, learning,  and research missions and supporting administrative functions. However, within  this open environment, the University must also preserve and safeguard its  electronic information resources and comply with applicable laws and regulations,  while facilitating activities the support the Universitys missions. In a highly  distributed technological environment, operation and management of electronic  information resources is broadly distributed.  This policy applies to all servers that Howard University ETS is responsible to  manage. This explicitly includes any system for which Howard University ETS  has an obligation to administer. This also includes all server systems setup for  internal use by HU regardless of whether ETS retains administrative obligation or  not.    Policy  Howard University ETS operational group responsible for system administration  and must manage all internal servers. Approved server conguration guides must  be established and maintained by each operational group, based on business needs  and approved by ETS. Operational groups should monitor conguration  compliance and implement an exception policy tailored to their environment.  Each operational group must establish a process for changing the conguration  guides, which includes review and approval by ETS.  11.1  Servers must be registered within the Enterprise Management System. At a    minimum, the following information is required to positively identify the point    of contact:     Server contact(s) and location, and a backup contact    Hardware and Operating System/Version     Main functions and applications, if applicable     Information in the Enterprise Management System must be kept up-to-   date.     11.2  Each device must meet the following minimum standards prior to, and after    connecting to the data network or support infrastructure:  Organization  ETS  Title/Subject  Network Security Policy  Document Number    Author  Christopher Cole   Approved by   Tilmon Smith  Date  April 10, 2014  Version  2.0  Page 6

  The device must be guarded by an up-to-date and active rewall set to    protect it from unauthorized network trafc.     Current operating system and application software with current    security patches must be installed.     The device must be protected against malicious or undesired     software such as viruses, spyware, or adware.     Access to the device must require appropriate authentication    controls such as account identiers and robust passwords.     The device must be certied and registered by ETS as equipment that    has met all security criteria, prior to connecting to the network.     11.3  SERVER GENERAL CONFIGURATION GUIDELINES       The following items serve as provisioning conguration guidelines for the        servers that are managed by ETS staff:    Operating System conguration should be in accordance with ETS-approved  guidelines.      Services and applications that will not be used must be disabled where  practical.      Access to services should be logged and/or protected through access-control  methods such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Wrappers.      The most recent security patches must be installed on the system as soon as  practical, the only exception being when immediate application would  interfere with business requirements.      Trust relationships between systems are a security risk, and their use should  be avoided. Do not use a trust relationship when some other method of  communication is available.      Do not use root account when a non-privileged account can performed the  task.      If a methodology for secure channel connection is available (i.e., technically  feasible), privileged access must be performed over secure channels, (e.g.,  encrypted network connections using SSH or IPsec).      Servers should be physically located in an access-controlled environment.

  Servers are specically prohibited from being operated in uncontrolled cubicle  areas.  11.4  Internal network addresses must not be publicly released.      The internal system addresses, configurations, and related system design information    systems and users outside the ETS internal network  cannot access this information.  11.5  All Internet Web servers must be firewall protected.   All connections between Howard Universitys internal networks and the Internet (or any  other publicly-accessible computer network) must be protected by a router, firewall, or  related access controls approved by ETS.  11.6  Public servers on Internet must be placed on separate subnets.      Public Internet servers must be placed on subnets separate  from internal ETS networks.  Routers or firewalls must be employed to restrict traffic from the public servers to  internal networks.  12.   MALWARE PROTECTION   Howard University ETS is entrusted with the responsibility to provide professional management  of the universitys servers as outlined in this policy. Inherent in this responsibility is an  obligation to provide appropriate protection against malware threats, such as viruses and spyware  applications. Effective implementation of this policy will limit the exposure and effect of  common malware threats to the systems they cover.  This policy applies to all servers that Howard University ETS is responsible to manage. This  explicitly includes any system for which ETS has an obligation to administer. This also includes  all server systems setup for internal use by Howard University, regardless of whether ETS  retains administrative obligation or not.  Policy  Howard University ETS operations staff will adhere to this policy to determine which servers  will have anti-virus and/or anti-spyware applications installed on them and to deploy such  applications as appropriate.   12.1.  ANTI-VIRUS  All servers MUST have an anti-virus application installed  that offers   real-time  scanning protection to files and applications running on the  target system if they meet  one or more of the following conditions:    Non-administrative users have remote access capability    The system is a file server  Organization  ETS  Title/Subject  Network Security Policy  Document Number    Author  Christopher Cole   Approved by   Tilmon Smith  Date  April 10, 2014  Version  2.0  Page 8

  NBT/Microsoft Share access is open to the server from systems used by non- administrative users    HTTP/FTP access is open from the Internet    Other risky protocols/applications are available to this system from the  Internet at the discretion of the Howard University IT Security Administration  All servers SHOULD have an anti-virus application installed that offers  real-time  scanning protection to files and applications running on the  target system if they meet  one or more of the following conditions:    Outbound web access is available from the system  12.2  MAIL SERVER ANTI-VIRUS  If the target system is a mail server it MUST have either an external or internal anti-virus  scanning application that scans all mail destined to and from the mail server. Local anti- virus scanning applications MAY be  disabled during backups if an external anti-virus  application still scans  inbound emails while the backup is being performed.  12.3  ANTI-SPYWARE  All servers MUST have an anti-spyware application installed that offers real-time  protection to the target system if they meet one or more of the following conditions:    Any system where non-technical or non-administrative users have remote  access to the system and ANY outbound access is permitted to the Internet    Any system where non-technical or non-administrative users have the ability  to install software on their own  12.4  NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS  An exception to the above standards will generally be granted with minimal resistance  and documentation if one of the following notable conditions applies to this system:    The system is a SQL server    The system is used as a dedicated mail server    The system is not a Windows based platform  12.5  Enforcement:    The responsibility for implementing this policy belongs to  all operational staff at  Howard University. Responsibility for ensuring that new and existing systems remain in  compliance with this policy resides with the  Howard University ETS Information  Security Officer. Any employee, student, faculty, guest, or contractors found to have  violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination  of employment.

13.   ROUTER   This policy describes a required minimal security configuration for all routers and switches  connecting to a production network or used in a production capacity at or on behalf of Howard  University ETS.  All routers and switches connected to Howard University IT production networks are affected.  Routers and switches within internal, secured labs are not affected. Routers and switches within  DMZ areas fall under the Internet DMZ Equipment Policy.  Policy  13.1. All routers within Howard University IT Enterprise must meet the     following configuration standards:    No local user accounts are congured on routers. Routers must use TACACS+ for    all user authentications.    The enable password on the router must be kept in a secure encrypted form. The    router must have the enable password set to the current production router    password from the routers support organization  13.2.  All routers within Howard University IT Enterprise must disallow the    following:    IP directed broadcast    Incoming packets at the router sourced with invalid addresses such as RFC1918 address    TCP small services    UDP small services    All source routing    All web services running on router    13.3.  Any external network connections, inbound or outbound, must be authenticated or  secured via approved standards.      Before dial-up users reach a log-in banner, all inbound dial- up lines connected to    Howard University IT internal networks and/or computer systems must pass    through an additional access control point, such as a firewall, which has been    approved by ETS. Unless ETS has first approved the action in writing, Howard    University staff must not enable any trusted host relationships between computers    connected to the Howard University internal network.  13.4.  Use Enterprise standardized SNMP (Simple Network Management    Protocol).
