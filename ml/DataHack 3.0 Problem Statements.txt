Cybersecurity Platform Featuring an AI-Driven Assessment Bot Cybersecurity Platform Featuring an AI-Driven Assessment Bot Objective: Welcome to the gritty underbelly of Liberty City,  where every organization is just one step away fro m a devastating cyberattack. Your mission: develop  an AI-driv en cybersecuri ty assessme nt b ot th at w ill navig ate the d ark all eys  o f a compan y’s dig ital infrastructure, probing for weaknesses with 30 0-400 dyn amic, relen tless ques tions a cross do main s like N etwork Sec urity , Data Prote ctio n, and I ncident Re spons e. T his  bot is mo re th an  just a to ol —it’s an elite operator, adapting to every answer, ca lculating real- time ris k sc ores, and d elivering ha rd-hitting reports with actionable insights. In a cit y where the next attack is always looming, your plat form will be the difference between survival and digital chaos.

Develop a web-based platform with an AI- powered bot that conducts a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment through 300-400 dynamic questions covering the following domains: Network Security Network Security Data Protection Incident Response Comp lian ce 
--- Page 13 ---
Key Features: Dynamic and Context-Aware Questioning: 1. Dynamic and Context-Aware Questioning: Feature: The bot will use Natural Language Proc essing (NLP) to ask dynamic and relevant question s based on the company’s previous respon ses. Follow-up questions will be trigger ed if vulnerabilities or areas of concern are identified. Example: If the organization lacks multi-factor  authentication (MFA), the bot will follow up with q uestions regarding other access control mechanisms . This ensures a comprehensive assessment of each domain.Note: The use of open-source LLMs or fine-tuning small language models (SLMs), which are more secure for privacy reasons and require less computational power is crucial.

2. Assessment of Infrastructure Documentation: Feature: Instead of starting with direct questions,  the bot will first allow the company to upload thei r infrastructur e documentatio n (e.g. , netwo rk diagrams, security policy documents, configurat ion file s). The bot w ill use NLP and t ext anal ysis techni que s to ana lyze  this documenta tion, identi fying pote ntial vulnerabili ties, gap s, o r non-compl iance a reas. Bas ed on  this anal ysis , t he bo t will ge nerate fol low-up que sti ons to  probe  furth er into s pecifi c are as th at need clarif ic ation or additional detail. Example: If the bot detects that there is no mention  of  encryption  protocols  in  the  uploaded  networ k configuration , i t wil l as k follow-u p question s abo ut h ow t he compa ny handl es da ta encrypti on, prob ing dee per i nto ar eas wh ere informat io n is lacking. Tech Suggestion: Use OCR (if needed) to convert scanned documents into machine-readable text and apply entity extraction techniques to identify key components like firewalls, encryption protocols, and access controls.

3. Real-Time Risk Scoring: Feature: The bot will use machine learning  models  to  analyze  responses  and  generate   a real-tim e ris k score . Thi s scor e provide s  an insta nt snapsh ot of t he organization 's secur ity posture and highlights areas requiring attention. Example: If incident response controls are found  to  be  weak,  the  risk  score  in  that  domain  wil l increase , markin g i t a s a high-priorit y are a f or improvement. 4. Detailed Report and Recommendations: Feature: After completing the assessment, the  bot  will  generate  a  comprehensive  report  tha t include s actionabl e recommendations . T he report will prioritize high-risk areas and sugg est tailored security improvements. Example: The bot may recommend specific  encryption  tools  for  data  protection  or  advis e schedulin g regula r securit y audit s fo r are as marked as high-risk.
